            SYNOPSIS
        </h4>
        <p>
            Once upon a time, in a far away swamp, there 
            lived an ogre named Shrek (Mike Myers) whose 
            precious solitude is suddenly shattered by an 
            invasion of annoying fairy tale characters. 
            They were all banished from their kingdom by 
            the evil Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow). 
            Determined to save their home -- not to mention
            his -- Shrek cuts a deal with Farquaad and sets
            out to rescue Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) to be
            Farquaad's bride. Rescuing the Princess may be small 
            compared to her deep, dark secret.

        </h4>
        <p>
            After returning from their honeymoon and showing
            home movies to their friends, Shrek and Fiona
            learn that her parents have heard that she has 
            married her true love and wish to invite him to 
            their kingdom, called Far Far Away. The catch is: 
            Fiona's parents are unaware of the curse that struck 
            their daughter and have assumed she married Prince 
            Charming, not a 700-pound ogre with horrible hygiene 
            and a talking donkey pal.

        </h4>
        <p>
            When King Harold suddenly croaks, Shrek 
            (Mike Myers) learns he will have to rule 
            the land of Far, Far Away, unless he can 
            find a suitable heir to the throne. The 
            most-promising candidate is Princess Fiona's 
            (Cameron Diaz) cousin Artie (Justin 
            Timberlake), a teenage slacker in a medieval 
            high-school. Shrek and his trusted companions, 
            Donkey (Eddie Murphy) and Puss in Boots 
            (Antonio Banderas), set out to bring Artie back 
            but find their mission is a bigger challenge 
            than they expected.
