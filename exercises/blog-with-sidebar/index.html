                        four older single women (three widows and one divorcée)
                        sharing a house in Miami. The owner of the house is a
                        widow named <span id=span1>Blanche Devereaux</span>
                        (McClanahan), who was joined by fellow widow
                        <span id=span1>Rose Nylund</span> (White) and divorcée
                        <span id=span1>Dorothy Zbornak</span> (Arthur) after
                        they both responded to an ad on the bulletin board of
                        a local grocery store a year before the start of the
                        series. In the pilot episode, the three are joined by
                        Dorothy's 80-year-old widowed mother, 
                        <span id=span1>Sophia Petrillo</span>(Getty), after 
                        the <span id=span1>retirement home</span>where she
                        has been living has burned down.

                        The first episode features a cook/butler named Coco
                        (played by <span id=span1>Charles Levin</span>), but
                        the role was dropped before the second episode. The
                        writers observed that in many of the proposed scripts,
                        the main interaction between the women occurred in the
                        kitchen while preparing and eating food. They decided
                        that a separate cook would distract from their
                        friendship. In addition, the character of Sophia had
                        originally been planned as an occasional guest star,
                        but Getty had tested positively with preview audiences,
                        so the producers decided to make her a regular
                        character.<span id=span1><sup>[10]</sup></span>

                        The Golden Girls came to an end when Bea Arthur chose
                        to leave the series. In the hour-long

                        May 1992, Dorothy meets and marries Blanche's uncle
                        Lucas( <span id=span1>Leslie Nielsen</span>) and moves
                        to Hollingsworth Manor in

                        but in the end, she stays behind with the other women
                        in Miami. This led into the spin-off series

                            marriage produced two children, Kate and Michael.

                        The Golden Girls was shot on videotape in front 
                        of a live studio audience.

                        episodes of the series followed a similar format
                        or theme. For example, one or more of the women
                        would become involved in some sort of problem,
                        often involving other family members, men, or an
                        ethical dilemma. At some point, they would gather
                        around the kitchen table and discuss the problem,
                        sometimes late at night and often while eating
                        cheesecake, ice cream, or some other dessert.

                        other girls then told a story from her own life,
                        which somehow related to the problem (though Rose
                        occasionally regaled the others with a nonsense
                        story that had nothing to do with the situation,
                        and Sophia told outrageous, made-up stories).
                        Some episodes featured flashbacks to previous
                        episodes, flashbacks to events not shown in
                        previous episodes, or to events that occurred
                        before the series began.

                        Although the writing was mostly comical, dramatic
                        moments and sentimental endings were included in
                        several episodes. Bea Arthur actually hated
                        cheesecake.<span id=span1><sup>[72]</sup></span>
