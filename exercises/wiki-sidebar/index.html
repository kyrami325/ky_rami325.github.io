                    The <span id=span1>ancient Olympic Games</span> 
                    <span id= span2>(Ancient Greek:</span> τὰ Ὀλύμπια, 
                    ta Olympia <span id= span2><sup>[1])</sup></span> 
                    were a series of <span id=span2>athletic competitions</span> 
                    among representatives of <span id=span2>city-states</span> 
                    and one of the <span id=span2>Panhellenic Games</span> of 
                    <span id=span2>Ancient Greece.</span> They were held at the 
                    <span id=span2>Panhellenic religious sanctuary</span> of
                    <span id=span2>Olympia</span>, in honor of 
                    <span id=span2>Zeus</span>, and the Greeks gave them a 
                    <span id=span2>mythological origin.</span> The originating 
                    Olympic Games are traditionally dated to 776 BC.
                    <span id=span2><sup>[2]</sup></span> The games were held 
                    every four years, or <span id=span2>Olympiad</span>, which 
                    became a unit of time in historical chronologies. These 
                    Olympiads were referred to based on the winner of their 
                    <span id=span2>stadion</span> sprint, e.g., "the third year 
                    of the eighteenth Olympiad when Ladas of Argos won the 
                    stadion". <span id=span2><sup>[3]</sup></span> They 
                    continued to be celebrated when Greece came under 
                    <span id=span2>Roman rule</span> in the 2nd century BC. 
                    Their last recorded celebration was in AD 393, under the 
                    emperor <span id=span2>Theodosius</span> I, but 
                    archaeological evidence indicates that some games were 
                    still held after this date.<span id=span2>
                    <sup>[4][5]</sup></span> The games likely came to an end 
                    under <span id=span2>Theodosius II</span>, possibly in 
                    connection with a fire that burned down the temple of the 
                    <span id=span2>Olympian</span> Zeus during his reign.
                    <sup><span id=span2>[6]</span></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                    During the celebration of the games, the 
                    <span id=span2>Olympic truce</span> (ekecheiría) was 
                    announced so that athletes and religious pilgrims could 
                    travel from their cities to the games in safety. The 
                    prizes for the victors were 
                    <span id=span2>olive leaf wreaths</span> or crowns. 
                    The games became a political tool used by city-states to 
                    assert dominance over their rival city states. Politicians
                     would announce political alliances at the games, and in 
                     times of war, priests would offer sacrifices to the gods 
                     for victory. The games were also used to help spread 
                     <span id=span2>Hellenistic culture</span> throughout 
                     the Mediterranean. The Olympics also featured religious
                    celebrations. The
                    <span id=span2>statue of Zeus at Olympia</span> was counted 
                    as one of the 
                    <span id=span2>seven wonders of the ancient world.</span>
                    Sculptors and poets would congregate each Olympiad to 
                    display their works of art to would-be patrons.

                    The ancient Olympics had fewer events than the modern 
                    games, and for many years only freeborn Greek men were 
                    allowed to participate,<sup><span id=span2>[7]</span></sup>
                    although there were victorious women chariot owners. 
                    Moreover, throughout their history, the Olympics, both 
                    ancient and modern, have occasionally become arenas where 
                    political expressions, such as demonstrations, boycotts, 
                    and embargoes, have been employed by nations and
                    individuals to exert influence over these sporting events.
                    <sup><span id=span2>[8]</span></sup>As long as they met the 
                    entrance criteria, athletes from any Greek city-state and 
                    kingdom were allowed to participate. The games were always 
                    held at Olympia rather than moving between different 
                    locations like the 
                    <span id=span2>modern Olympic Games</span>
                    <sup><span id=span2>.[9]</span></sup> Victors at the 
                    Olympics were honored, and their feats chronicled for 
                    future generations.

                    Origin Mythology
                </h2>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    To the Ancient Greeks, it was important to root 
                    the Olympic Games in <span id=span2>mythology.</span>
                    <span id=span2><sup>[10]</sup></span> During the time of 
                    the ancient games their origins were attributed to the 
                    gods, and competing legends persisted 
                    as to who actually was responsible for the genesis of the
                    games.<span id=span2><sup>[11]</sup></span> The patterns 
                    that emerge from these legends are that the Greeks believed
                    the games had their roots in religion, that athletic
                    competition was tied to worship of the gods, and the 
                    revival of the ancient games was intended to bring peace, 
                    harmony and a return to the origins of Greek life.
                    <span id=span2><sup>[12]</sup></span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    These origin traditions have become nearly impossible to 
                    untangle, yet a chronology and patterns have arisen that 
                    help people understand the story behind the games.
                    <span id=span2><sup>[13]</sup></span> Greek historian 
                    <span id=span2>Pausanias</span> provides a story about 
                    the <span id=span2>dactyl</span> Heracles (not to be 
                    confused with the <span id=span2>Hercules</span> who was 
                    the son of <span id=span2>Zeus</span> and joined the Roman 
                    pantheon) and four of his brothers, Paeonaeus, 
                    </span>Epimedes</span>, <span id=span2>Iasius</span> and
                    <span id=span2>Idas</span>, who raced at 
                    <span id=span2>Olympia</span> to entertain the newborn 
                    Zeus. He crowned the victor with an 
                    <span id=span2>olive wreath</span> (which thus became 
                    a peace symbol), which also explains the four-year 
                    interval, bringing the games around every fifth year 
                    (counting inclusively). 
                    <span id=span2><sup>[14][15]</sup></span> The other 
                    Olympian gods (so named because they lived permanently on 
                    <span id=span2>Mount Olympus)</span> would also engage in 
                    wrestling, jumping and running contests.
                    <span id=span2><sup>[16]</sup></span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another myth of the origin of the games is the 
                    story of <span id=span2>Pelops</span>, a local 
                    <span id=span2>Olympian</span> hero. 
                    <span id=span2>Oenomaus</span>, the king of 
                    <span id=span2>Pisa</span>, had a daughter named 
                    <span id=span2>Hippodamia</span>, and according to an 
                    oracle, the king would be killed by her husband. 
                    Therefore, he decreed that any young man who wanted 
                    to marry his daughter was required to drive away with 
                    her in his chariot, and Oenomaus would follow in another 
                    chariot, and spear the suitor if he caught up with them. 
                    Now, the king's chariot horses were a present from the god 
                    <span id=span2>Poseidon</span> and therefore supernaturally 
                    fast. The king's daughter fell in love with a man called 
                    Pelops. Before the race however, Pelops persuaded Oenomaus' 
                    charioteer <span id=span2>Myrtilus</span> to replace the 
                    bronze axle pins of the king's chariot with wax ones. 
                    Naturally, during the race, the wax melted and the king 
                    fell from his chariot and was killed. After his victory, 
                    Pelops organized chariot races as a thanksgiving to the 
                    gods and as funeral games in honor of King Oenomaus, in 
                    order to be purified of his death. It was from this funeral 
                    race held at Olympia that the beginnings of the Olympic 
                    Games were inspired. Pelops became a great king, 
                    a local hero, and he gave his name to the 
                    <span id=span2>Peloponnese</span>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One (later) myth, attributed to 
                    <span id=span2>Pindar</span>, states that the festival
                    at Olympia involved <span id=span2>Heracles</span>, 
                    the son of Zeus: According to Pindar, Heracles established
                    an athletic festival to honor his father, Zeus, after he 
                    had completed his <span id=span2>labors</span>.

                    Prehistory
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Areas around the Mediterranean had a long tradition of 
                    athletic events. Ancient Egyptians and Mesopotamians 
                    depicted athletic scenes in tombs of kings and their 
                    nobles. They did not, however, hold regular competitions, 
                    and those events that occurred were probably the preserve
                    of kings and upper classes. <span id=span2>Minoan</span>
                    culture held gymnastics in high esteem, with 
                    <span id=span2>bull-leaping</span>, tumbling, running, 
                    wrestling and boxing shown on their frescoes. The
                    <span id=span2>Mycenaeans</span> adopted Minoan games and
                    also raced chariots in religious or funerary ceremonies.
                    <span id=span2><sup>[18][19]</sup></span> 
                    <span id=span2>Homer's</span>heroes participate 
                    in athletic competitions to honor the dead. In the 
                    <span id=span2>Iliad</span> there are chariot races, 
                    boxing, wrestling, a foot race, as well as fencing, 
                    archery, and spear throwing. The Odyssey adds to these 
                    a long jump and discus throw.

                    First Games
                </h3>
                <p>
                    <span id=span2>Aristotle</span> reckoned the date of 
                    the first Olympics to be 776 BC, a date largely 
                    accepted by most, though not all, subsequent ancient 
                    historians. <span id=span2><sup>[22]</sup></span> This is 
                    the traditionally given date and archaeological finds 
                    confirm, approximately, the Olympics starting at or 
                    soon after this time. 
                    <span id=span2><sup>[23]</sup></span> 
                    While this specific date of origin cannot be verified, 
                    it is generally accepted that the games date from some 
                    time in the 8th century BC.

                <p>
                    Archaeology suggests that major games at Olympia arose
                    probably around 700. Christesen's important work on the 
                    Olympic victor lists shows that victors' names and 
                    details were unreliable until the sixth century. Elis's 
                    independent state administered it, and while the Eleans 
                    managed the games well, there sometimes was bias and 
                    interference. Also, despite modern illusions, the famous
                    Olympic truce only mandated safe passage for visitors; 
                    it did not stop all wars in Greece or even at  
                    <span id=span2>Olympia</span>.

                    the period between two games. Previously, the local dating
                    systems of the Greek states were used (they continued to 
                    be used by everyone except historians), which led to 
                    confusion when trying to determine dates. For example, 
                    Diodorus states that there was a solar eclipse in the 
                    third year of the 113th Olympiad, which must be the 
                    eclipse of 316 BC. This gives a date of (mid-summer) 765 
                    BC for the first year of the first Olympiad. 
                    <span id=span2><sup>[29]</sup></span> Nevertheless, there 
                    is disagreement among scholars as to when the games began.

                    the only competition held at first was the

                    Early History
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Several groups fought over control of the sanctuary at 
                    Olympia, and hence the games, for prestige and political 
                    advantage. Pausanias later writes that in 668 BC, Pheidon 
                    of <span id=span2>Argos</span> was commissioned by the 
                    town of  <span id=span2>Pisa</span> to capture the 
                    sanctuary from the town of  <span id=span2>Elis</span>, 
                    which he did and then personally controlled the games 
                    for that year. The next year, Elis regained control.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Greek sports also derived its origins from the concept
                    that physical energy was being expended in a ritualistic 
                    manner, in which Paleolithic age hunting practices were 
                    turned into a more socially and glamorized function, 
                    thus becoming sport. The Greeks in particular were unique
                    in the regard that their competitions were often held 
                    in grand facilities, with prizes and nudity that 
                    stressed the Greek idealisms of training one's body to 
                    be as fit as their mind. It is this ideology and athletic
                    exceptionalism that resulted in theories claiming the 
                    Greeks were the inventors of sport.
                    <span id=span2><sup>[32]</sup></span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the first 200 years of the games' existence, they 
                    only had regional religious importance. Only Greeks 
                    in proximity to Olympia competed in these early games.
                    This is evidenced by the dominance of Peloponnesian 
                    athletes in the victors' roles.
                    <span id=span2><sup>[33]</sup></span> 
                    Over time, the Olympic Games gained increasing recognition
                    and became part of the 
                    <span id=span2>Panhellenic Games</span>, four separate 
                    games held at two- or four-year intervals, but arranged 
                    so that there was at least one set of games every year. 
                    The other Panhellenic Games were the 
                    <span id=span2>Pythian</span>, 
                    <span id=span2>Nemean</span>, and 
                    <span id=span2>Isthmian Games</span>, though the Olympic 
                    Games, being the oldest among the rest, were considered 
                    the most prestigious.
                    <span id=span2><sup>[34]</sup></span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Participation in the Olympic Games was reserved for 
                    freeborn Greek men, although there were also Greek 
                    women who were victorious as chariot owners. Authorities
                    differ as to whether females were allowed to attend the
                    competitions. Some say all females were excluded from the
                    sacred precinct where the games took place,
                    <span id=span2><sup>[35]</sup></span> while others cite 
                    Pausanias who indicated that parthenoi (maidens) could 
                    view the competitions, but not gynaikes (married women),
                    who had to remain on the south side of the river 
                    <span id=span2>Alpheios</span>.
                    <span id=span2><sup>[36]</sup></span> 
                    The evidence regarding the attendance of women in the 
                    Olympics is inconclusive. Nevertheless, there is no 
                    specific evidence suggesting that women were excluded 
                    from attending the other Panhellenic or Panathenaic 
                    contests.<span id=span2><sup>[37]</sup></span>

                    Power in <span id=span2>ancient Greece</span> 
                    became centered around the 
                    <span id=span2>city-state</span> (polis) in the 8th 
                    century BC.<span id=span2><sup>[54]</sup></span>The 
                    city-state was a population center organized into a 
                    self-contained political entity.
                    <span id=span2><sup>[55]</sup></span> Every city-state 
                    worshiped the same <span id=span2>pantheon of gods</span>,
                    although each one often gave more emphasis on a limited 
                    group of deities and celebrated religious festivals based
                    on various calendars.<span id=span2><sup>[34]</sup></span>
                    These city-states often lived in close proximity to each 
                    other, which created competition for limited resources. 
                    Though conflict between the city-states was ubiquitous, 
                    it was also in their self-interest to engage in trade, 
                    military alliances, and cultural interaction.
                    <span id=span2><sup>[56]</sup></span>The city-states had
                    a dichotomous relationship with each other: on one hand,
                    they relied on their neighbors for political and military
                    alliances, while on the other they competed fiercely with 
                    those same neighbors for vital resources.
                    <span id=span2><sup>[57]</sup></span> In this political 
                    context the Olympic Games served as a venue for 
                    representatives of the city-states to peacefully 
                    compete against each other.
                    <span id=span2><sup>[58]</sup></span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    From the 8th century BC onwards, the city-states expanded
                    with the establishment of <span id=span2>colonies</span> 
                    in the Mediterranean and the Black Sea. While their cults 
                    and sanctuaries provided a sense of identity, those local
                    identities as well as the increasing contacts with
                    non-Greek populations presented the Greeks with the need
                    to define themselves not only as members of a certain 
                    polis but also as <span id=span2>Hellenes</span>.That was
                    made possible on the basis of a common language and a body
                     of shared myths and legends. Their fondness in athletic 
                     festivals and religious observance were additionally 
                     important factors for the Greek self-definition. As such,
                    a small number of religious festivals assumed a 
                    <span id=span2>panhellenic</span> character and were 
                    reserved for members of all Greek city-states; the oldest
                    of them being the Olympic Games. A body of officials was
                    responsible for determining the city-state of origin and
                    the Greek identity of the competitors, known as 
                    <span id=span2>Hellanodikai</span>.

                    The spread of Greek colonies in the 6th and 5th centuries
                    BC is repeatedly linked to successful Olympic athletes. 
                    For example, Pausanias recounts that 
                    <span id=span2>Cyrene</span>was founded c. 630 BC by 
                    settlers from <span id=span2>Thera</span>with 
                    <span id=span2>Spartan</span> support. The support Sparta
                    gave was primarily the loan of three-time Olympic 
                    champion Chionis. The appeal of settling with an Olympic
                    champion helped to populate the colonies and maintain 
                    cultural and political ties with the city-states near 
                    Olympia. Thus, <span id=span2>Hellenic</span> culture
                    and the games spread while the primacy of Olympia 
                    persisted.<span id=span2>[60]</span>

                <p>
                    During the Olympic Games, a truce, or ekecheiria was 
                    observed. Three runners, known as spondophoroi, were 
                    sent from <span id=span2>Elis</span> to the participant
                    cities at each set of games to announce the beginning 
                    of the truce.<span id=span2><sup>[61]</sup></span> During
                    this period, armies were forbidden from entering Olympia.
                    Legal disputes and the use of the death penalty were
                    forbidden. The truce — primarily designed to allow
                    athletes and visitors to travel safely to the games — was,
                    for the most part, observed.
                    <span id=span2><sup>[61]</sup></span>
                    <span id=span2>Thucydides</span> wrote of a situation when
                    the <span id=span2>Spartans</span> were forbidden from 
                    attending the games, and the violators of the truce were
                    fined 2,000 <span id=span2>minae</span> for assaulting the
                    city of <span id=span2>Lepreum</span> during the period of
                    the ekecheiria. The Spartans disputed the fine and claimed
                    that the truce had not yet taken hold.<span id=span2>

                    The games faced a serious challenge during the 
                    <span id=span2>Peloponnesian War</span>, which primarily
                    pitted Athens against Sparta, but in reality touched
                    nearly every Hellenic city-state.
                    <span id=span2><sup>[64]</sup></span> The Olympics were
                    used during this time to announce alliances and offer

                    While a martial truce was observed by all participating
                    city-states, no such reprieve from conflict existed in
                    the political arena. The Olympic Games evolved the most
                    influential athletic and cultural stage in ancient Greece,
                    and arguably in the ancient world.
                    <span id=span2><sup>[65]</sup></span> As such the games 
                    became a vehicle for city-states to promote themselves. 
                    The result was political intrigue and controversy. For 
                    example, <span id=span2>Pausanias</span>, a Greek 
                    historian, explains the situation of the athlete Sotades,
                    Sotades at the ninety-ninth Festival was victorious in the
                    long race and proclaimed a Cretan, as in fact he was. 
                    But at the next Festival he made himself an Ephesian,
                    being bribed to do so by the Ephesian people. For this
                    act he was banished by the Cretans.
