                she said the best of both worlds. 
                These tacos are the most delicious 
                fusion twist packed with spicy 
                ahi tuna and creamy homemade spicy 
                mayo, all nestled in crispy nori 
                taco shells. It’s a fun and 
                flavorful way to enjoyyour favorite 
                sushi but handheld in a seaweed

                    CRAFTING THE SPICY AHI TUNA
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Begin by finely chopping fresh ahi
                    tuna into small, bite-sized pieces.
                    In a bowl, marry the tuna with creamy
                    mayonnaise, sriracha sauce, soy sauce,
                    a drizzle of sesame oil, a splash of
                    lime juice for brightness, and optional
                    thinly sliced green onions for a pop of
                    freshness. Combine together and there you
                    have it! So quick and easy to make.

                <p>
                    NOTE: You can purchase sashimii-grade
                    tuna at a Japanese fish market suitable
                    for eating raw. If you do not have one
                    close by, you can always replace it
                    with a different cooked seafood.
                    Another option is to use tofu for
                    a vegetarian version.

                <h4>
                    PERFECTING THE SPICY MAYO
                </h4>
                <p>
                    No sushi taco is complete without a
                    dollop of spicy mayo to add a creamy
                    kick to every bite. Crafting this
                    luscious condiment is a walk in the
                    park and it’s my favorite make in
                    fact. In a small bowl, combine
                    mayonnaise with some sambal,
                    additional sriracha for an extra
                    punch of heat, a drizzle of sesame
                    oil for depth of flavor, a touch
                    of sugar to balance the spice, and
                    a squeeze of lemon juice to brighten
                    the ensemble. Mix until smooth and
                    velvety, ready to grace your sushi
                    tacos with its tantalizing presence.
                </p>          
                <p>
                    NOTE: For the mayonnaise, try to use
                    Kewpie mayo for the best flavor but
                    any will do if you don’t have it.
                    You can find it in most supermarkets
                    in the international aisle but your
                    best bet is an Asian market.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, if you are not familiar with
                    sambal, it is a chili paste that
                    you can find in a lot of grocery
                    stores as well. I like to add it
                    to my spicy mayo but it is totally
                    not necesarry. You can just add
                    more sriracha in its place.
                    <h4>
                        CREATING THE NORI TACO SHELLS
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Now that filling and sauce is prepared,
                        let’s move on to making the taco shells
                        which is the fun part but also a bit
                        more complex! We’re basically going to
                        take nori/seaweed sheets and cut them
                        into small squares. Then we’ll make a
                        tempura batter and dunk the nori in
                        only on one side and then fry until
                        golden and then we can shape it into
                        a trianguar taco and stuff it. That’s
                        the short version, now let’s get
                        into the nitty gritty!
                    </p>   
                    <p>
                        Begin by preparing a light and airy
                        tempura batter, combining all-purpose
                        flour, cornstarch, baking powder, and
                        a symphony of spices including salt,
                        black pepper, paprika, chili powder,
                        and garlic powder. To this dry mix,
                        add cold club soda and a whisked egg,
                        stirring until a smooth batter forms.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now, the magic begins as we dip the
                        nori squares into the tempura batter
                        only on one side while ensuring the
                        edges are also coated for extra
                        crispiness. Gently lower the battered
                        nori into hot vegetable oil, allowing
                        it to sizzle and crisp up to golden
                        perfection. As it emerges from the oil,
                        fold the nori diagonally to form the
                        iconic taco shell shape, and let it
                        rest on a wire rack to drain off any
                        excess oil. And there you have a taco
                        shell made from seaweed and tempura.
                        On to the next step!

                        With all the components prepared,
                        it’s time to assemble our sushi 
                        tacos. Begin by filling each nori 
                        taco shell with a bit of cooked
                        jasmine rice. Next, spoon on a 
                        generous dollop of the spicy 
                        ahi tuna.

                    <p>
                        To add a refreshing crunch, fill 
                        your tacos with thinly sliced
                        avocado and cucumber. For a final 
                        finish, drizzle the assembled tacos
                        with eel sauce and spicy mayo, 
                        sprinkle with toasted sesame seeds,
                        and garnish with thinly sliced 
                        green onions.

                        <li>
                            Start by making the tempura 
                            batter. In a bowl, whisk together 
                            all-purpose flour, cornstarch,
                            baking powder, salt, black pepper,

                            garlic powder.

                        <li>
                            Add the club soda and egg and 
                            whisk again to combine until 
                            fully incorporated and set 
                            aside.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            To a deep frying pan, add 
                            vegetable oil and heat 
                            to 350°F.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Once hot, dip the nori/seaweed 
                            square into the tempura batter 
                            only on one side. Dip the edges 
                            as well and drop into the oil, 
                            tempura batter side down. Fry 
                            until crispy and golden.

                            Fold diagonally in half 
                            immediately to create the 
                            taco shell shape and let it 
                            drain off oil on a wire rack.

                        <li>
                            Repeat with the rest of the nori.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Once the shells are done, fill
                            them with rice, tuna, and veggies
                            and finish off a drizzle of eel 
                            sauce and spicy mayo to enjoy!
