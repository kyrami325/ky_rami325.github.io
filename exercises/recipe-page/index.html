                    CRAFTING THE SPICY AHI TUNA
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Begin by finely chopping fresh ahi
                    tuna into small, bite-sized pieces.
                    In a bowl, marry the tuna with creamy
                    mayonnaise, sriracha sauce, soy sauce,
                    a drizzle of sesame oil, a splash of
                    lime juice for brightness, and optional
                    thinly sliced green onions for a pop of
                    freshness. Combine together and there you
                    have it! So quick and easy to make.

                <p>
                    NOTE: You can purchase sashimii-grade
                    tuna at a Japanese fish market suitable
                    for eating raw. If you do not have one
                    close by, you can always replace it
                    with a different cooked seafood.
                    Another option is to use tofu for
                    a vegetarian version.

                    PERFECTING THE SPICY MAYO
                </h4>
                <p>
                    No sushi taco is complete without a
                    dollop of spicy mayo to add a creamy
                    kick to every bite. Crafting this
                    luscious condiment is a walk in the
                    park and it’s my favorite make in
                    fact. In a small bowl, combine
                    mayonnaise with some sambal,
                    additional sriracha for an extra
                    punch of heat, a drizzle of sesame
                    oil for depth of flavor, a touch
                    of sugar to balance the spice, and
                    a squeeze of lemon juice to brighten
                    the ensemble. Mix until smooth and
                    velvety, ready to grace your sushi
                    tacos with its tantalizing presence.
                </p>          
                <p>
                    NOTE: For the mayonnaise, try to use
                    Kewpie mayo for the best flavor but
                    any will do if you don’t have it.
                    You can find it in most supermarkets
                    in the international aisle but your
                    best bet is an Asian market.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, if you are not familiar with
                    sambal, it is a chili paste that
                    you can find in a lot of grocery
                    stores as well. I like to add it
                    to my spicy mayo but it is totally
                    not necesarry. You can just add
                    more sriracha in its place.
                    <h4>
                        CREATING THE NORI TACO SHELLS
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Now that filling and sauce is prepared,
                        let’s move on to making the taco shells
                        which is the fun part but also a bit
                        more complex! We’re basically going to
                        take nori/seaweed sheets and cut them
                        into small squares. Then we’ll make a
                        tempura batter and dunk the nori in
                        only on one side and then fry until
                        golden and then we can shape it into
                        a trianguar taco and stuff it. That’s
                        the short version, now let’s get
                        into the nitty gritty!
                    </p>   
                    <p>
                        Begin by preparing a light and airy
                        tempura batter, combining all-purpose
                        flour, cornstarch, baking powder, and
                        a symphony of spices including salt,
                        black pepper, paprika, chili powder,
                        and garlic powder. To this dry mix,
                        add cold club soda and a whisked egg,
                        stirring until a smooth batter forms.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now, the magic begins as we dip the
                        nori squares into the tempura batter
                        only on one side while ensuring the
                        edges are also coated for extra
                        crispiness. Gently lower the battered
                        nori into hot vegetable oil, allowing
                        it to sizzle and crisp up to golden
                        perfection. As it emerges from the oil,
                        fold the nori diagonally to form the
                        iconic taco shell shape, and let it
                        rest on a wire rack to drain off any
                        excess oil. And there you have a taco
                        shell made from seaweed and tempura.
                        On to the next step!

                    <p>
                        With all the components prepared,
                        it’s time to assemble our sushi 
                        tacos. Begin by filling each nori 
                        taco shell with a bit of cooked
                        jasmine rice. Next, spoon on a 
                        generous dollop of the spicy 
                        ahi tuna.
                    </p>   
                    <p>
                        To add a refreshing crunch, fill 
                        your tacos with thinly sliced
                        avocado and cucumber. For a final 
                        finish, drizzle the assembled tacos
                        with eel sauce and spicy mayo, 
                        sprinkle with toasted sesame seeds,
                        and garnish with thinly sliced 
                        green onions.
