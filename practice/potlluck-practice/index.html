            Boone, North Carolina-based Rainbow Kitten
            Surprise (RKS) is an alternative rock/indie
            band. College students Sam Melo and Darrick
            "Bozzy" Keller started the band in 2013 
            after starting to compose and record music
            in their dorm rooms at Appalachian State 
            University. Since then, Ela Melo on vocals, 
            Ethan Goodpaster on electric guitar, and Jess 
            Haney on drums have joined the group, along 
            with other musicians.

            In addition to having three full-length albums
            out, including How to: Friend, Love, Freefall,
            RKS is well-known for their live performances.
            Artists such as Frank Ocean, Schoolboy Q, Kings
            of Leon, and Modest Mouse had a great influence
            on their sound. Some claim that their lyrics
            contain both subtle and overt references to the
            Bible, which may come naturally to lead singer
            Sam Melo as he spent a lot of his childhood with
            his missionary parents in the Caribbean.

            DESCRIPTION
        </h4>
        <p>
            Early in 2013, the band's debut EP, Mary, 
            was released by lead singer Sam Melo and 
            guitarist and backup vocalist Darick 
            "Bozzy" Keller before they came together 
            as the present Rainbow Kitten Surprise.
            <br>
            <br>
            Before releasing their debut album, Seven,
            the pair would go on to add members Ethan 
            Goodpaster (lead guitar), Charlie Holt 
            (bass), and Jess Haney (drums). The two 
            projects were swiftly merged and reissued 
            under the name Seven + Mary.
            <br>
            <br>
            Mary, which makes up the final four tracks
            of Seven + Mary, stands apart from the rest
            of the record due to its sparse instrumentals
            and straightforward song structure.

        <p>
            The 2018 album How To: Friend, Love, Freefall
            by Rainbow Kitten Surprise delves into topics 
            of friendship, love, and loss. The record 
            serves as a guide through the joy and warmth 
            of love and friendship, as well as the anguish 
            and sorrow that might accompany them. The songs
            on the album are full with history, melancholy,
            and optimism, as the title suggests. Additionally,
            there are more overt religious overtones on the 
            album than there were in the group's earlier releases.
            <br>
            <br>
            The album's 36 minutes are filled with complex melodies
            and profound lyrics. Instrumentalists Derick "Bozzy"
            Keller, Ethan Goodpaster, Charlie Holt, and Jess Haney 
            accompany the band's lead singer, Ela Melo. Some claim
            that the album shows the band's development, with each
            song enhancing the other.

        <p>
            Rainbow Kitten Surprise's fourth studio album
            is titled Love Hate Music Box. Through pop, 
            electronic, rock, and hip-hop, among other genres, 
            the album delves into the intricacies of relationships 
            and life's ups and downs. Lead singer Ela Melo, 
            lead producer Konrad Snyder (Noah Kahan), and producer
            Daniel Tashian (Kacey Musgraves) produced the album. 
            <br>
            <br>
            "Peter Pan," "Overtime," "Superstar," "Lucky," and "LOL"
            are among the 22 tracks on the album. Kacey Musgraves is 
            included on the album "Overtime," which some claim keeps
            listeners on their toes by experimenting with various sounds.
            The album has received high marks from critics, and some 
            claim the band's music is still evolving.
